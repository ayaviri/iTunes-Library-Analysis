ok, so i want to make sense of the available listening data from itunes and its outputted xml
file. let's make an initial version that outputs everthing as text

in order to run an update query in mysql-connect, the timestamp objects must be of type string.
this conversion can be done using the datetime.strftime() method, which converts python datetime 
objects into the appropriate string for insertion into a sql query

in addition to this, in order to insert a timestamp object, single quotes must be placed around
the value placeholder in order to be read correctly. otherwise, the string is treated as a scalar
or a literal
